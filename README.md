### Installation
After downloading the repository, open a terminal in the main file and use 'npm install' to get the appropriate dependencies. This app uses mysql to store database information. You will need a localhost connection running on your machine with the default port of '3306'. You will also need to open the file named 'index.js' and rename the variables located under the 'USER VARIABLES' header. rename userName to the user you would like to run mysql with, and userPassword to your appropriate mysql password. Finally, in the same terminal you used before, simply use the command 'node index' whenever you wish to run the app.

### Usage
When the app starts, you will be prompted with many options for how to view and manipulate the database. If it is your first time running the app, you will need to create some departments first. You can create these, as well as roles and employees by selecting the 'add to database' option on the first prompt. You will be prompted to give the department a name. When creating roles and employees you will need to input multiple pieces of information. The code will error and stop if the information inputted is in the wrong format or if it ever refers to another item in the database that does not exist. Unless otherwise specified all pices of information should be given as simple text. If you are asked for the id of an item, you will need to input a number.

You can view the id of any object in the database by selecting 'View Database' on the main prompt and then selecting the category of item you wish to see. 

You can also delete items from the database by selcting 'Delete' from the main prompt. 

Finally, you may update an employee's role by selcting 'Update Employee' from the main prompt, and then inputting information in the same way as when creating a new item.
